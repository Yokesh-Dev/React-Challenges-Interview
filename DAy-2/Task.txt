🚀 Day 2 — Todo App (Hard Mode)

⏳ Time limit target: 45–60 minutes
📄 Start from a blank file
🧠 Think → Write → Fix loop (no overthinking)

🔥 Requirements

Build a Todo List component with:

1️⃣ Add a todo

Input field

Button to add a new todo

2️⃣ Display list of todos

Render todos using .map()

3️⃣ Delete a todo

Each todo item must have a delete button

4️⃣ Mark todo as complete / incomplete

Checkbox or button to toggle completed state

UI should update (e.g., line-through completed items)

5️⃣ Filter todos

Buttons or tabs to filter:

All

Completed

Incomplete / Active

⚠ Rules

No copy–paste from existing code

Google only when stuck (1–2 minutes max)

Keep writing even if you’re unsure → fix later

If something breaks, don’t delete everything — fix step by step

🎨 (Optional UI bonus — not required)

If you finish early, add localStorage support so todos remain after refresh.

🧩 Hints (only read if stuck)

You do NOT need these now — but keep them in mind:

Feature	Helpful concept
Add todo	Array spread + setState
Delete	filter()
Toggle completed	map()
Filtering	Derived list using .filter()
