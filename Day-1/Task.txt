🚀 Day 1 — React Interview Coding Challenge

⏳ Time limit: 20 minutes
📄 Start from a blank file
🧠 Think → Write → Fix loop (no overthinking)

🔥 Task

Build a Counter component with the following features:

Requirements

1️⃣ Display the current count

⛔ Rules (important)

No copy-paste from old code

No searching until you try yourself first

After finishing once → run and check

If something isn't working → fix it, don’t rewrite from scratch
